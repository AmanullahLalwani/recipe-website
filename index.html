<body><h1>Pakistani Chicken Korma – Authentic Recipe</h1>
 <p>Chicken korma – when I think of korma, honestly, I think back to a time when I was rather averse to Pakistani food as a teen (I know, how the tables have turned).</p>  
<h2>What is a korma?</h2>
<p>A korma is a meat-based curry dish made using a base of fried onions crushed and yogurt. It includes lots of warming, rich spices and is often served at special events such as weddings, parties and Eids.  It’s a fancier-than-your-average-chicken-curry, luxurious dish and it is believed to have originated from the kitchens of the Mughal royals</p>

<h2>What makes a Pakistani chicken korma authentic?</h2>
<p>When I talk about an authentic chicken korma, I go by what my mother has always told me. She’s always been firm that a korma is inherently different to other curries – it has distinct features that shouldn’t be toy with, otherwise it isn’t a korma anymore. Those are:</p>
<li>One of it’s most striking, distinct features – crispy fried onions, crushed by hand and added in towards the end of the cook-time. 
<li>Ok, gotta get this off my chest. I have seen loads of korma recipe variations which purée the onions before frying – I say nay to this because it’s impossible to get the same level of browning with purée vs sliced onions. This impacts the depth of flavour and the end colour. I’m totally a purist in this regard here – no to puréed onions in korma, please!
<li>You may also be tempted to keep your hands clean and just toss the fried onions into a grind for a nice, smooth paste. I know, so much easier, isn’t it? But another distinct feature of the korma is the grainy texture of the sauce – a silky smooth sauce is not what a traditional korma is like. If you really don’t want to get your hands dirty, then you may use a pestle and mortar to crush the fried onions but don’t crush them into a fine powder or paste. Texture is good!
